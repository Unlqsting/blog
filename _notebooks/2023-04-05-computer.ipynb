    "> As we have learned, a computer needs aa program to do something smart.  The sequence of a program initiates a series of actions with the computers Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component is essentially a binary machine focussing on program instructions provided.  The CPU retrieives and stores the data it acts upon in Random Access Memory (RAM). Between the CPU, RAM, and Storage Devices a computer can work with many programs and large amounts of data.\n",

    "    - Access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an internet connected device.\n",
    "    - A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.\n",
    "    - The protocols used in the internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the internet.\n",

    "    - Information is passed through the internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets. \n",
    "    - Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the internet, as well as for data reassembly.\n",
    "    - Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all\n",
